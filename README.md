# DeCon

This is the source code for the paper  "DeCon"

# Requirements

- Keras
- python 3.x

# Train and Test

Our three model：

- Model_GRU.py——implement by *GRU* in Keras
- Model-LSTM.py——implement by *LSTM* in Keras
- Model-RNN.py——implement by *Simple RNN* in Keras
- PrecessData.py——Pre-process data for Model
- search.py --To construct the directed graphs centered on each head entity h

The data is load from: https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE and do process
